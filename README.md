# Weight Scale

### Objective

Put weight on the scale by slicing through fruit.

### About

In Weight Scale, you control a slicer that can cut through fruit. The fruit are flying across the screen and it is the players job to slice them down. When the fruit get sliced, they drop their meat which weighs different amounts, and they hit a scale, increasing the weight. If five fruit cross the entire screen without being sliced, the game is over. 

### Preview 

A "Preview" section with a gameplay video with footage of your game. You can use OBSLinks to an external site., Zoom, or any other reasonable solution to create and upload the video to YouTube, then link the video directly into your markdown file. You may not record the game on your cellphone. You are free to additionally take screenshots of your game too.

### Instructions

You can control the slicer using the spacebar key, moving it up if it is at the bottom or down if it is at the top.
